# Phase 3 Build Roadmap

> **Diataxis type:** Reference + how-to — sequenced delivery plan for Phase 3 (Hosted Beta), with verification checklists per stage. Mirrors the Phase 1 and Phase 2 roadmaps; consumed by `superpowers:executing-plans` and the after-stage verification step in `CLAUDE.md`.

> **Principles:** Spec-Driven Development (spec before code) · Test-Driven Development (failing test before implementation) · SOLID architecture maintained throughout · loud-failure over silent-failure (every cross-tenant boundary throws or logs explicitly).
>
> **TDD rule:** Every new service method, business rule, security mechanism, and financial calculation gets a failing test written first. The test must fail because the implementation does not exist — not because it is misconfigured. Controllers are excluded (thin HTTP handlers, verified via `WebApplicationFactory` integration tests). Infrastructure plumbing (migrations, DI wiring, reverse proxy) is verified by smoke tests, not by unit tests against the plumbing itself.
>
> **UI/UX rule:** Phase 3 introduces auth screens, onboarding, sessions/support pages, and the GDPR consent banner — every new SPA page is built to the design system at first ship (no second-pass redesign). For frontend changes, follow `CLAUDE.md` § Frontend Work: invoke `frontend-design`, run the UX/UI verification checklist in the browser, run `web-design-guidelines` before commit.
>
> **Security gate rule:** Stages that introduce or modify security-sensitive code (auth, multi-tenancy, sessions, email, headers) cannot be marked done without their verification checklist green. The verification list for each stage is drawn from `security-model.md`, `multi-tenancy-strategy.md`, and the ADRs — items there are not optional.

## Stage 0 — Phase 3 foundational decisions (Batch 3a)

**Status: ✅ Done (2026-05-07).** Five ADRs locked; doc-sync complete.

Five architectural decisions were locked before any Batch 3 implementation began, in keeping with `multi-tenancy-strategy.md`'s requirement that "global query filters must be set up before any multi-user service code is written — retrofitting is harder than applying from the start."

### Sub-stages

| # | Decision | Outcome | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Auth cookie `SameSite` posture | `Lax`, paired with CSRF tokens, `__Host-` prefix, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, re-auth on sensitive ops | [ADR-0063](decisions/ADR-0063-cookie-samesite-lax-with-csrf-tokens.md) |
| 0.2 | Social login in scope for Phase 3? | Deferred to Phase 4; architecture stays open | [ADR-0064](decisions/ADR-0064-social-login-deferred-to-phase-4.md) |
| 0.3 | EF Core global query filters? | Adopted on every user-owned entity + explicit `.Where()` redundancy + `IgnoreQueryFilters()` reserved for `Admin/` namespace (architecture-test enforced) | [ADR-0065](decisions/ADR-0065-ef-global-query-filters-with-explicit-redundancy.md) |
| 0.4 | Sentinel-to-real-user migration approach | Remap sentinel to first registered user in a single transaction; preserves Phase 1/2 personal-finance history | [ADR-0066](decisions/ADR-0066-sentinel-remap-to-first-registered-user.md) |
| 0.5 | Background-process user resolution | `IUserScope.EnterAs(userId)` foundation + `IUserJobRunner.ForEachUserAsync` runner; `ICurrentUserAccessor` throws on missing context (no silent `Guid.Empty`) | [ADR-0067](decisions/ADR-0067-background-job-user-scope-with-iuserscope-and-runner.md) |

### Verification checklist

- [x] All five ADRs written and committed (commit `d2460d2`)
- [x] `multi-tenancy-strategy.md` § Background processes flipped from "open hazard" to "Resolved by ADR-0067"
- [x] `multi-tenancy-strategy.md` § Settings Table Migration flipped to remap-to-first-user
- [x] `multi-tenancy-strategy.md` § EF Core Global Query Filters flipped from "Optional Optimization" to adopted
- [x] `security-model.md` § Cookie Configuration `SameSite` line flipped from open-decision to `Lax` per ADR-0063
- [x] `planning-resolved.md` lists all five ADR decisions (commit `fd101d0`)
- [x] `planning-phase3.md` § Planned Features Authentication bullet reflects social-login deferral
- [x] `planning-phase3.md` § 14 Implementation order Settings/Sessions line points at Batch 5
- [x] `planning-phase3-spa-migration.md` Batch 3/4 paragraph cross-references the new `planning-phase3.md § Phase 3 execution batches` section
